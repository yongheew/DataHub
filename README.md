## Introduction
Incident reporting in many organizations is still scattered across notebooks, messaging apps, and shift summaries. This fragmentation makes it difficult to detect recurring issues, preserve institutional memory, or identify operational risks early.

DataHub addresses this gap by applying AI to interpret frontline reports, connect related incidents, and surface meaningful patterns — enabling supervisors to act faster and allocate resources more effectively.
